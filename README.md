Project Overview:
This Project is the development of a unified web-based platform designed to improve the overall healthcare experience by integrating four core services. The solution will provide  patients the ability to pre-book appointments with an efficient check-in process, give users access to nearby lab testing centers and pharmacy services and also access to their medical records from medical centers they have visited. The platform will enhance patient safety, convenience, and operational efficiency across hospitals, clinics, lab centers and pharmacies, driving improved healthcare delivery in Ghana and beyond.
 Problem Statement:
•	Many first-time patients face long queues, and a lack of clear guidance about hospital processes, which can result in delays, stress, and sometimes even abandonment of care.
•	Patients often struggle to find nearby lab testing centers or pharmacies, and if they do, the process of booking appointments and managing prescriptions and bridging the results can be inefficient and time-consuming. 
•	 People struggle to track their medical history across different hospitals.


 Solution Overview:
pVault – a comprehensive, integrated web-based platform that combines hospital check-in management, interconnected lab testing and pharmacy services and medical records access.  This solution will empower patients, healthcare providers, independent lab technicians and pharmacists with the tools they need to streamline processes, improve safety, foster collaboration, maintain a comprehensive medical record and ensure timely access to healthcare services.
